This program analyzes data from the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration's Global Surface Summary of the Day (NOAA GSOD).

Data is read as .csv. Temperature, humidity, and visibility are sorted by magnitude. Across years, categories are compared day-to-day to express change in weather as linear movement between many categories.

These changes are then expressed as equations to describe trends in the weather since 1970.
